          Hi, I’m Malaika, a passionate Front-End Developer who loves to create visually appealing and user-friendly web applications. I’m deeply fascinated by how technology shapes our world, and my love for coding drives me to continuously explore and learn new things in the tech space.</p>

<p className='mt-8'>I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and enjoy working with modern frameworks like React and Next.js to build responsive, dynamic web experiences. My work is all about merging design with functionality, and I’m always on the lookout for new ways to improve user interaction and experience.</p>

<p className='mt-8'>
Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge through Gen AI Government Program, where I’m diving deeper into artificial intelligence and its impact on technology. This program has given me the opportunity to learn from the best and apply those learnings in real-world scenarios, pushing me to become a more well-rounded developer.
